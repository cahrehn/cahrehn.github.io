title: Retiring an email address

To mark this beginning with an ending, I'm retiring an email address that's about as old as YouTube. It's because more and more people are deciding [imapotato](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_1UoKpZid8) should be their internet persona. The list includes:

- Thomas Cowell, a Masonic Lodge member in New England.
- Michael Marquez, who applied for a Tech Support job.
- Melissa Chung, who did *not* appreciate the sexually charged trailer for Breaking Dawn.
- David Keller, a retiree in his 70s that ordered a replacement part for a vaporizer.

Not to buzz market, but these are some of the places I've gotten invites and sign-ups for:

* Newsletter for pacificgolf.co.jp
* Newsletter for York Maze
* Howrse (3 times)
* Instabang
* NFL Fantasy Football

After the voyeuristic rush of peeking into the life of a complete stranger wore off, I realized that there's not much that can be done. Most of the messages are legitimate email for their intended recipients, so they won't get marked as spam. I obviously can't email any of these people, and trying to contact them indirectly through their accounts has been an uphill battle.

So after 5 years of getting other peoples' email, I've changed or abandoned all the accounts that used the old email address and will have to accept the fact that I'm not *the* potato.
