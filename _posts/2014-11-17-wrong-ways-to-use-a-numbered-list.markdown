title: 3 wrong ways to use a numbered list

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">I can think of at least three incorrect ways to use a numbered list:</p>

1. "x ways to [blank] your [blank]!"
1. "x something something, pictures of animals."
1. This list.

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">There are a few legitmate uses cases for <a href="http://blog.apastyle.org/apastyle/2010/03/lists-part-5-bulleted-lists.html">numbered lists</a>:</p>

* "Numbered lists can be used to denote items in a series, such as conclusions or procedural steps."
* "Numbered lists can be useful to show the relationship between items: a chronology of events, each itemâ€™s relative importance, and so on."

Here's a numbered list done right:

It's an ordered series that reveals the relative importance of each of those people and creates a chronology. If Beatrix had written the names in a different order, there would be tangible consequences.

Most lists are more like [Oliver Queen's](http://arrow.wikia.com/wiki/The_List):
<img src="/assets/images/arrow-list.png" title="Robert Queen's notebook" />
where there's no inherent ordering and he'll get to them when he'll get to them. Similarly, the order in which you look at someone's favorite cat pictures _doesn't matter_.

Next time you start writing a list, think about whether the items are part of a series, have a quantitative relationship to each other, or if it matters how many of them there are. I'd bet not. Chances are that you want is a bulleted list or a [checklist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5qqfsQGYus) instead.
